(since 2.0.0-M2)

The framework supports for different targets to be associated with
tooltip effects, that trigger on `mouse-over`. These effects utilize
`java-script` and are rendered without delay. Targets are

* Action Buttons
* Action Parameters
* Menu Actions _(mouse-over the `Tooltip Demo` menu entry)_
* Entity Properties and Collections
* Table Column Headers

*Described As* (Targets: Action, Parameter, Property, Collection)

[source,java]
----
@ActionLayout(describedAs="tooltip text goes here")
@ParameterLayout(describedAs="tooltip text goes here")
@PropertyLayout(describedAs="tooltip text goes here")
----

*Disabled Reason* (Targets: Action)

[source,java]
----
@Action
public void anAction(){
    // do something
}

public String disableAnAction() {
    return "tooltip text goes here";
}
----

*Editing Disabled Reason* (Targets: Property)

[source,java]
----
@Property(
    editingDisabledReason="tooltip text goes here")
----
