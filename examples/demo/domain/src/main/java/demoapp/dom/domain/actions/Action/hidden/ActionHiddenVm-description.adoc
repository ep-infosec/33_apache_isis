== Regular Actions

Four actions:

* `updateTextNoAnnotation` does not specify whether it is hidden or not.
The fallback is that actions are not hidden:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionHiddenVm.java[tags=action-no-annotation]
----

* `updateTextAndHiddenNowhere` action is explicitly annotated as not hidden:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionHiddenVm.java[tags=action-hidden-nowhere]
----

* `updateTextButHiddenEverywhere` action is explicitly annotated as hidden everywhere.
It therefore should not be visible in the UI:
+
[source,java]
----
include::ActionHiddenVm.java[tags=action-but-hidden-everywhere]
----

* `updateTextAndHiddenOnForm` action is explicitly annotated as hidden on an object form.
It therefore should not be visible in the UI:
