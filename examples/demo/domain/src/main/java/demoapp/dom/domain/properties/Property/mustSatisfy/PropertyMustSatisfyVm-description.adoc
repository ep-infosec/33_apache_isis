The `mustSatisfy` element specifies an arbitrary constraint that the value entered into the property must satisfy:

* for properties, the element can be specified using either the `@Property` annotation, or a meta-annotation

* for parameters, the element can be specified using either the `@Parameter` annotation, or a meta-annotation.

The constraint is provided as a concrete class that implements the `org.apache.causeway.applib.spec.Specification` interface.
This is usually done by subclassing `AbstractSpecification` or `AbstractSpecification2`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::OfWorkingAgeSpecification.java[tags=class]
----

TIP: it is possible to inject domain services into ``Specification``S.

This semantic can apply to all types, although the provided `Specification` must be compatible, in other words accept the same data type (or a supertype) of the property.


== Annotated

The `mustSatisfy` element can be specified explicitly using an annotation:

* for properties, using `@Property#mustSatisfy()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMustSatisfyVm.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that the property holds an integer in the range 18 to 65
+
where `OfWorkingAgeSpecification` is:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::OfWorkingAgeSpecification.java[tags=class]
----

* for parameters, using `@Parameter#mustSatisfy()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMustSatisfyVm_updateWithParameterLayout.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that the parameter holds an integer in the range 18 to 65

The annotation could also be applied to a mixin, but would have little effect because mixin properties are always read-only.

== Meta-annotated

CAUTION: this feature is currently broken, see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAUSEWAY-2415[CAUSEWAY-2415].

The `mustSatisfy` element can also be specified using a custom meta-annotation:

* the meta-annotation is defined as:
+
[source,java]
----
include::MustSatisfyOfWorkingAgeMetaAnnotation.java[tags=class]
----
<.> annotated for a property ...
<.> \... and for a parameter.
<.> annotation can be applied to a property (either its getter or the field directly)
<.> annotation can be applied to a parameter

* and can be applied to a property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMustSatisfyVm.java[tags=meta-annotated]
----
<.> semantic is inherited from the meta-annotation

* or can be applied to a parameter:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMustSatisfyVm_updateWithMetaAnnotation.java[tags=meta-annotation]
----
<.> semantic is inherited from the meta-annotation


=== Meta-annotated Overridden

CAUTION: this feature is currently broken, see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAUSEWAY-2415[CAUSEWAY-2415].

The meta-annotation can itself be overridden:

* in a property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMustSatisfyVm.java[tags=meta-annotated-overridden]
----
<.> semantic from meta-annotation ...
<.> \... is overridden by the `@Property` annotation

* or a parameter:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyMustSatisfyVm_updateWithMetaAnnotationOverridden.java[tags=meta-annotation-overridden]
----
<.> semantic from meta-annotation ...
<.> \... is overridden by the `@Parameter` annotation

* where `OfRetirementAgeSpecification` is:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::OfRetirementAgeSpecification.java[tags=class]
----
