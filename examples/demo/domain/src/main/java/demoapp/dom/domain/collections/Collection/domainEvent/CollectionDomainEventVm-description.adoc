Usually a domain event is emitted by the framework to emit whenever the user interacts with a collection.
Domain service subscribers can influence these interaction by subscribing to these events, allowing them to:

* hide the collection

(In contrast to properties), because collections can only be modified indirectly (eg through an action), there are no other interactions that can be influenced.

The `domainEvent` element specifies the class to be emitted; this must be a subclass of the abstract `org.apache.causeway.applib.events.domain.CollectionDomainEvent` class.

If no `domainEvent` is specified on the property itself, then the domain event class can be specified at the class level using `@DomainObject#collectionDomainEvent`.

And if not specified at the class level, then an instance of `org.apache.causeway.applib.events.domain.CollectionDomainEvent.Default` is emitted as the fallback.

[TIP]
====
The fallback domain event can be suppressed using the `causeway.applib.annotation.collection.domain-event.post-for-default` configuration property.

== Annotated Collection

In the demo, the `CollectionDomainEventVm` class defines a collection, "children", annotated with `domainEvent`:

[source,java]
----
include::CollectionDomainEventVm.java[tags=class]
----
<.> the event class to emit; genericised by the target type and the property type
<.> indicates that the framework should emit this type


== Subscriber

The `CollectionDomainEventControlService` is the subscriber:

[source,java]
----
include::subscribers/CollectionDomainEventControlService.java[tags=class]
----
<.> holds which "strategy" should be used to modify the interactions with the text field
<.> subscribes using the Spring event bus


== Influencing the Interaction

The mechanisms to influence the interactions are implemented as an enum.
The `DO_NOTHING` enum, unsurprisingly, does nothing:

[source,java]
----
include::subscribers/CollectionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=class]
----

There is one further option:

* hide
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::subscribers/CollectionDomainEventControlStrategy.java[tags=hide]
----

=== Selecting the Strategy

Selecting which strategy is in force is implemented using two mixins which work together:

* the `controlChildren` mixin property just surfaces the selected strategy as a read-only value:
+
[source,java]
----
include::subscribers/CollectionDomainEventVm_controlChildren.java[tags=class]
----

* while the `controlChildrenEditing` mixin action allows the strategy to be changed:
+
[source,java]
----
include::subscribers/CollectionDomainEventVm_controlChildrenVisibility.java[tags=class]
----
<.> forces the page to redraw.
Necessary because the text property's state change
