TODO this yet is just a copy from JDO

This class is a parent entity that contains an embedded type as a property:

[source,java]
.NumberConstantJdo.java
----
include::NumberConstantJpa.java[tags=class]
----
<.> JDO `@Embedded` annotation inlines the constituent parts of the value type as columns of the owning entity
<.> maps the 'ComplexNumber.re' property to column `number_re`
<.> maps the 'ComplexNumber.im' property to column `number_im`
