CAUTION: TODO: can also use `@Nullable`, for parameters at least.

The `optionality` element specifies that a property or parameter is either optional or mandatory:

* for properties, the element can be specified using either the `@Property` annotation, or a meta-annotation

* for parameters, the element can be specified using either the `@Parameter` annotation, or a meta-annotation

Without an annotation, the framework assumes that the property or parameter is mandatory, ie required.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In addition to specifying optionality at the framework level, it's also important to specify optionality for properties at the persistence layer.

* in the case of entities persisted using JDO/DataNucleus, this can be done using `@Column(allowsNull=...)`.
* in the case of view models serialized using JAXB, this can be done using `@XmlElement(required=...)`.

Also note that JDO and JAXB assume a property is not required by default, whereas Apache Causeway assumes that properties are required by default.

== Annotated

The `optionality` element can be specified explicitly using an annotation:

* for properties, using `@Property#optionality()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyOptionalityVm.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that the property is optional

* for parameters, using `@Parameter#optionality()`:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyOptionalityVm_updateWithParameterLayout.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that the parameter is optional

The annotation could also be applied to a mixin, but would have little effect because mixin properties are always read-only.

== Meta-annotated

The `optionality` element can also be specified using a custom meta-annotation:

* the meta-annotation is defined as:
+
[source,java]
----
include::OptionalityOptionalMetaAnnotation.java[tags=class]
----
<.> annotated for a property ...
<.> \... and for a parameter.
<.> annotation can be applied to a property (either its getter or the field directly)
<.> annotation can be applied to a parameter

* and can be applied to a property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyOptionalityVm.java[tags=meta-annotated]
----
<.> semantic is inherited from the meta-annotation

* or can be applied to a parameter:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyOptionalityVm_updateWithMetaAnnotation.java[tags=meta-annotation]
----
<.> semantic is inherited from the meta-annotation


=== Meta-annotated Overridden

The meta-annotation can itself be overridden:

* in a property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyOptionalityVm.java[tags=meta-annotated-overridden]
----
<.> semantic from meta-annotation ...
<.> \... is overridden by the `@Property` annotation

* or a parameter:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyOptionalityVm_updateWithMetaAnnotationOverridden.java[tags=meta-annotation-overridden]
----
<.> semantic from meta-annotation ...
<.> \... is overridden by the `@Parameter` annotation
