.Inline markup
* single quotes around a phrase place 'emphasis'
* astericks around a phrase make the text *bold*
* double astericks around one or more **l**etters in a word make those letters bold
* double underscore around a __sub__string in a word emphasize that substring
* use carrots around characters to make them ^super^script
* use tildes around characters to make them ~sub~script

ifdef::basebackend-html[]
* to pass through +++<u>HTML</u>+++ directly, surround the text with triple plus
endif::basebackend-html[]
ifdef::basebackend-docbook[]
* to pass through +++<constant>XML</constant>+++ directly, surround the text with triple plus
endif::basebackend-docbook[]


// separate two adjacent lists using a line comment (only the leading // is required)

- characters can be escaped using a {backslash}
* for instance, you can escape a quote inside emphasized text like 'Here\'s Johnny!'
- you can safely use reserved XML characters like <, > and &, which are escaped when rendering
- force a space{sp}between inline elements using the \{sp} attribute
- hold text together with an intrinsic non-breaking{nbsp}space attribute, \{nbsp}
- handle words with unicode characters like in the name Gregory Rom√©
- claim your copyright (C), registered trademark (R) or trademark (TM)

You can write text http://example.com[with inline links], optionally{sp}using an explicit link:http://example.com[link prefix]. In either case, the link can have a http://example.com?foo=bar&lang=en[query string].

If you want to break a line +
just end it in a {plus} sign +
and continue typing on the next line.
