The `commandPublishing` element is used to allow or suppress the reification of a property edit into a xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command].


When allowed (the default), then the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command] is sent to registered implementation(s) of https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-M5/applib-svc/CommandSubscriber.html#section-top[CommandSubscriber] SPI, _after_ the interaction has completed.
One use case is to replicate and replay commands to a secondary system, for example for regression testing.
For more on this, see the "Command Replay" section below.

Commands are also used under the covers to allow property edits to be made asynchronously using the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-M3/applib-svc/WrapperFactory.html[WrapperFactory].

[NOTE]
====
The list of persisted xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command]s can be viewed in a collection at the left bottom of the page.
xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command]s are persisted after the page rendering phase, so to view a just-persisted command, refresh the page.

If running in prototype mode, the list of persisted xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command]s can also be truncated from the activity menu.
====

== Annotated

The `commandPublishing` element can be specified explicitly using an annotation through `@Property#commandPublishing()`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyCommandPublishingJdo.java[tags=annotation]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that invoking the action should be reified .

The command publishing can also be disabled:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyCommandPublishingJdo.java[tags=annotation-2]
----
<.> explicitly specifies that invoking the action should not be reified.


== Meta-annotated

The `commandPublishing` element can also be specified using a custom meta-annotation:

* the meta-annotation is defined as:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../PropertyCommandPublishingEnabledMetaAnnotation.java[tags=class]
----
<.> annotated for a property
<.> annotation can be applied to a property field or getter method

* and can be applied to a property:
+
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyCommandPublishingJdo.java[tags=meta-annotation]
----
<.> semantic is inherited from the meta-annotation


=== Meta-annotated Overridden

The meta-annotation can itself be overridden:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::PropertyCommandPublishingJdo.java[tags=meta-annotation-overridden]
----
<.> semantic from meta-annotation ...
<.> \... is overridden by the `@Property` annotation



== CommandSubscriber

The demo includes the link:https://causeway.apache.org/extensions/2.0.0-M3/commandlog/about.html[Command Log] extension, so every command is persisted.
These can be viewed in the collection at the bottom of the left page.
xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command]s are persisted after the page rendering phase, so to view a just-persisted command, refresh the page.


== Configuration

By default, reification of commands for action invocations is enabled.
This can be configured globally:

[source,yaml]
.application.yml
----
causeway:
  applib:
    annotation:
      property:
        command: none   # or 'all', or 'ignore_safe'
----

In addition to globally enabling or disabling command reification, it is also possible to specify `ignore_safe`.
This enables commands for all actions except those that have safe (that is, query-only) semantics.
In other words actions are reified to commands except for those that don't change (aren't declared as changing) the state of the system.

== Command Replay

The link:https://causeway.apache.org/extensions/2.0.0-M3/commandlog/about.html[Command Log] extension provides an implementation of `CommandServiceListener` to allow xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command]s to be persisted.
It also provides a RESTful endpoint to allow xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command]s to be queried.
This is used by the link:https://causeway.apache.org/extensions/2.0.0-M3/commandreplay/about.html[Command Replay] extension to allow commands to be replayed on a secondary system, for regression testing.

The associated `commandDtoProcessor()` element allows the xref:refguide:applib:index/services/command/Command.adoc[Command] XML representation (as a `CommandDto`) to be processed before being surfaced through the REST endpoint.
One use case is to allow data to be obfuscated for security, or to replace large payloads (such as Blobs) with a smaller dummy payload.
As well as specifying DTO processing at the action level, it can be specified globally by implementing the link:https://causeway.apache.org/refguide/2.0.0-M3/applib-svc/CommandDtoProcessorService.html[CommandDtoProcessorService] SPI.

The command replay can be demonstrated by running a second instance of the demo app, using the "secondary" Spring Boot profile.
This is most easily done by specifying a system property:

    -Dspring.profiles.active=secondary

This activates the `application-secondary.properties` configuration file:

[source,properties]
----
causeway.extensions.commandreplay.primary-access.base-url-restful=http://localhost:8080/restful/
causeway.extensions.commandreplay.primary-access.user=sven
causeway.extensions.commandreplay.primary-access.password=pass
causeway.extensions.commandreplay.primary-access.base-url-wicket=http://localhost:8080/wicket/

server.port=9090
----

The secondary instance of demoapp is accessible at link:http://localhost:9090[].
Since both primary and secondary start with the same initial state, any commands executed on the primary are replicated to the secondary and result in the same changes of state.
