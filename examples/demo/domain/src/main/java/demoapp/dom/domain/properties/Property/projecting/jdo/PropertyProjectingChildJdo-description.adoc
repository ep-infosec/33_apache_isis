This is the backing entity projected by the  `PropertyPublishingChildVm` view model:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../child/PropertyProjectingChildVm.java[tags=class]
----
<.> projecting property ...
<.> \... does not need to be visible in the user interface

Normally such an entity would have many different properties, with some visible (in tables) in some contexts, other properties in others.
A projecting view model acts as a projection of the entity, only surfacing the properties of the underlying entity that are most useful in the context of the use case in question.
