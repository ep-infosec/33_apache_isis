As part of the release process we xref:post-release-successful.adoc#generate-website[generate] and publish the website.
An (intentional) side-effect of this process is to create a branch for the release (that is, `{page-causewayrel}`).
This branch can then be used for documentation updates.

== Update docs

Prereqs:

* jdk 11
* mvn 3.x
* groovy 3.x
* pandoc 2.x
* dos2unix

In the regular `causeway` repo:

* Check out the branch:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git checkout {page-causewayrel}
----

* make documentation updates, and commit changes

* make sure the tooling is also built:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
mvn -D module-tooling -D skip.essential install -DskipTests
----

* generate the website:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
sh preview.sh
----
+
NOTE: this now runs `mvn clean install -pl core/config` automatically (unless suppressed with a flag)

This updated website is written to `antora/target/site`; we'll use the results in the xref:#publish-website[next section].
