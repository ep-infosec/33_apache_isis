| `ViewModel` implementations were required to have at least a _public_ single argument constructor, 
taking a `String` argument for the `ViewModel's` memento.
| `ViewModel` implementations now allow *any* _public_ constructor signature, 
where arguments are auto-resolved by the `ServiceRegistry`.

`String` arguments still get the `ViewModel's` memento passed in.

If the `ViewModel` has multiple _public_ constructors, it picks (the) one, 
that has an `@Inject` or `@Autowired` annotation.
