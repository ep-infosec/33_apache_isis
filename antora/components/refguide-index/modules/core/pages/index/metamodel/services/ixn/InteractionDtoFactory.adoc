Used to serialize the execution of an action invocation or property edit as an _org.apache.causeway.schema.ixn.v2.InteractionDto_ , for example that it can be published to downstream systems.

There are some similarities to _org.apache.causeway.core.metamodel.services.command.CommandDtoFactory_ , which is used to instantiate an _org.apache.causeway.schema.cmd.v2.CommandDto_ that represents the _intention_ to invoke an action or edit a property.
