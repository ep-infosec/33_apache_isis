This value, if specified, is used in the serialized form of the object's xref:refguide:applib:index/services/bookmark/Bookmark.adoc[Bookmark] . A xref:refguide:applib:index/services/bookmark/Bookmark.adoc[Bookmark] is used by the framework to uniquely identify an object over time (same concept as a URN). Otherwise, if not specified, the default Spring Bean name is used instead.
