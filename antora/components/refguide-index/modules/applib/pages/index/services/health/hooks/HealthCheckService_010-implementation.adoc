== Implementation

The framework provides no default implementation, but the xref:docs:starters:simpleapp.adoc[simpleapp] starter app provides a link:https://github.com/apache/causeway-app-simpleapp/blob/master/webapp/src/main/java/domainapp/webapp/application/services/health/HealthCheckServiceImpl.java[sample implementation]:

[source,java]
----
@Service
@Named("domainapp.HealthCheckServiceImpl")
@Log4j2
public class HealthCheckServiceImpl implements HealthCheckService {

    private final SimpleObjects simpleObjects;

    @Inject
    public HealthCheckServiceImpl(SimpleObjects simpleObjects) {
        this.simpleObjects = simpleObjects;
    }

    @Override
    public Health check() {
        try {
            simpleObjects.ping();
            return Health.ok();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            return Health.error(ex);
        }
    }
