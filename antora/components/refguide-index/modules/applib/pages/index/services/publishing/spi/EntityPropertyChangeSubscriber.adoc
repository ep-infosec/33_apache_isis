SPI called for each pre-post change to a property of a domain entity during a result of the transaction. The callback is therefore quite fine-grained and will be called many (many) times for within any given transaction.

Only those properties of entities that have publishing enabled (using * _DomainObject#entityChangePublishing()_ ) are included.
