== Implementation

The framework provides a number of default implementations for JPA and JDO, to recognise:

* data already exists (uniqueness constraints)
* object not found
* related data exists (foreign key constraints preventing change)
* unable to save data (foreign key constraints not met)
* other data access problem.


// TODO: v2 - flesh this out once CAUSEWAY-2502 is complete.

//=== Configuration Properties
//
//The following configuration properties are relevant:
//
//[cols="2a,1,3a", options="header"]
//|===
//|Property
//|Value +
//(default value)
//|Description
//
//| `causeway.services.` +
//`exceprecog.` +
//`logRecognized` +
//`Exceptions` +
//|`true`,`false` +
//(`false`)
//|whether recognized exceptions should also be logged. +
//
//Generally a recognized exception is one that is expected (for example a uniqueness constraint violated in the database) and which does not represent an error condition.
//This property logs the exception anyway, useful for debugging.
//
//This is recognised by all implementations that subclass `ExceptionRecognizerAbstract`.
//
//| `causeway.services.` +
//`ExceptionRecognizer` +
//`CompositeFor` +
//`JdoObjectStore.` +
//`disable` +
//|`true`,`false` +
//(`false`)
//|whether to disable the default recognizers registered by `ExceptionRecognizerCompositeForJdoObjectStore`. +
//
//This implementation provides a default set of recognizers to convert RDBMS constraints into user-friendly messages.
//In the (probably remote) chance that this functionality isn't required, they can be disabled through this flag.
//
