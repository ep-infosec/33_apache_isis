[#PUBLIC]
=== PUBLIC

Specification for use by third-party clients, ie public use and not under the control of the authors of the backend Apache Causeway application.

The generated swagger spec is therefore restricted only to include only view models ( _DomainObject#nature()_ of _org.apache.causeway.applib.annotation.Nature#VIEW_MODEL_ ) and to REST domain services ( _DomainService#nature()_ of _NatureOfService#REST_ ). Exposing entities also would couple the REST client too deeply to the backend implementation.

[#PRIVATE]
=== PRIVATE

Specification for use only by internally-managed clients, ie private internal use.

This visibility level removes all constraints and so includes the specifications of domain entities as well as view models. This is perfectly acceptable where the team developing the REST client is the same as the team developing the backend service ... the use of the REST API between the client and server is a private implementation detail of the application.

[#PRIVATE_WITH_PROTOTYPING]
=== PRIVATE_WITH_PROTOTYPING

As _#PRIVATE_ , also including any prototype actions (where _Action#restrictTo()_ set to _RestrictTo#PROTOTYPING_ ).
