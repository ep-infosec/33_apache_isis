This guide introduces the xref:userguide:fun:concepts-patterns.adoc[core concepts] and provides an xref:userguide:fun:overview.adoc[overview] of the building blocks of Apache Causeway applications.

It next describes the basics of the Apache Causeway' programming model: xref:userguide:fun:domain-entities-and-services.adoc[domain entities and services], xref:userguide:fun:object-members.adoc[object members], xref:userguide:fun:ui.adoc[UI layout and hints], xref:userguide:fun:business-rules.adoc[business rules] and xref:userguide:fun:drop-downs-and-defaults.adoc[drop downs and defaults].
This includes a discussion on xref:userguide:fun:domain-entities-and-services.adoc#object-management-crud[the basic CRUD operations].


It then moves on to discuss some slightly more advanced areas of the programming model: xref:userguide:fun:meta-annotations.adoc[meta-annotations], xref:userguide:fun:view-models.adoc[view models] and xref:userguide:fun:mixins.adoc[mixins].
These all allow you to develop more sophisticated applications, while remaining maintainable and elegant.
There is also a discussion on how to structure your application using xref:userguide:fun:modules.adoc[modules].

Finally the xref:userguide:btb:about.adoc[Beyond the Basics] tackles some more advanced topics.
