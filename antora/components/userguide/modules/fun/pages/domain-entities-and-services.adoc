[NOTE]
====
This section describes entities using JDO annotations, but (the more widely used) JPA (in conjunction with Spring Data) is also supported.

See the xref:pjdo:ROOT:about.adoc[JDO/DataNucleus] and xref:pjpa:ROOT:about.adoc[JPA/Eclipselink] documentation for more details on how to configure one or the other.
