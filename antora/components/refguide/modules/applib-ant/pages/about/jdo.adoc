Discriminator]
|Override for the object type, as used in `Bookmark`s, URLs for xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] and elsewhere. +

|xref:refguide:applib-ant:PersistenceCapable.adoc[@javax.jdo.annotations. +
PersistenceCapable]
|Used to build Apache Causeway' own internal identifier for objects. +

If the `schema` attribute is specified (and if xref:refguide:applib-ant:Discriminator.adoc[@Discriminator] __hasn't__ been specified), is also used to derive the object type, as used in `Bookmark`s, URLs for xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[RestfulObjects viewer] and elsewhere.
