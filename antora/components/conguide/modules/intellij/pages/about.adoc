== Code Style / Initial IDE Configuration

Additional configuration of IntelliJ for contributors (and committers).

* Set up the link:{attachmentsdir}/Apache-Causeway-importorder.xml[import order].

== Prepare for Build

The project/artifact `causeway-core-privileged` is required to be an _automatic module_
in the _Java Platform Module System_ (JPMS) sense. (It has unrestricted access to the class-path
but not the module-path.)

WARNING: As of time of writing, _IntelliJ IDEA_ does *not* support automatic module name resolution
for projects that are also *opened* in the IDE. Instead it will resolve such module names
only from *ignored* projects, that previously had been built and installed via _Maven_ to the
local repository. (Typically `~/.m2/repository`).
