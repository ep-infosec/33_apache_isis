This chapter describes the command line tooling used to automatically generate documentation from the program sources (eg `.java` source code and Maven `pom.xml` project files).

The tooling itself is accessed through a xref:tooling:tooling-cli:about.adoc[command line interface (CLI)] tool.

The tools are used both during the xref:comguide:ROOT:cutting-a-release.adoc[release process] and on an adhoc basis.
