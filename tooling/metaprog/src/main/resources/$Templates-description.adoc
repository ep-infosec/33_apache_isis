//#{generated-file-notice}

The framework has built-in support for the `#{showcase-type}` data type.

From here you can:

* navigate to an entity that uses the `#{showcase-type}` datatype
* open a view model that uses the `#{showcase-type}` datatype

Some properties on these domain objects are mandatory, some optional.

== Common interfaces

The entity and view model types both implement some common interfaces.

=== #{showcase-name}Holder

The `#{showcase-name}Holder` interface is used to contribute a number of mixins to both types:

[source,java]
----
include::holder/$TemplateHolder.java[tags=class]
----

=== #{showcase-name}Holder2

The `#{showcase-name}Holder2` interface is used to demonstrate support for label positions using `@PropertyLayout(labelPosition=...)`.

Further details, along with the effect of this annotation, can be seen on the entity and view model object pages.
