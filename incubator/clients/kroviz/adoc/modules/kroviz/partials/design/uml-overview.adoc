note right of ResourceProxy
When ever a resource is required, the proxy is queried.
(1) It's served from the <b>EventStore</b>, if possible. <b>LogEntry.cacheHits</b> will be incremented.
(2) If it's not available yet, <b>XHR</b> fetches it from remote and puts it into the <b>EventStore</b>.

In any case, a <b>LogEntry</b> containing the response (blob) will be passed on to it's aggregator(s).

The aggregator to be used is either determined at the point where the resource is requested,
or, based on the content of the response, assigned by the matching handler.
end note
