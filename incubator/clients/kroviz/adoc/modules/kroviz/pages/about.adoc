The Kroviz client provides a user interface for Apache Causeway applications, the same as other viewers such as the xref:vw:ROOT:about.adoc[Web UI (Wicket viewer)].
Krovix is called a "client" (rather than a "viewer") because it runs within the web browser, and consumes the REST API provided by the xref:vro:ROOT:about.adoc[REST API (Restful Objects viewer)].
