/**
 * Represents the <i>intention to</i> invoke either an action or modify a property.  There can be only one such
 * intention per (web) request, so a command is in effect interaction-scoped.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each Command holds a {@link CommandDto} (see Apache Causeway <a href="http://causeway.apache.org/schema/cmd/">cmd</a> schema)
 * which reifies all the details in a serializable form.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     It also captures details of the corresponding action invocation (or property edit),
 *     specifically when that action/edit {@link Command#getStartedAt() started} or
 *     {@link Command#getCompletedAt() completed}, and its result, either a {@link Command#getResult() return value}
 *     or an {@link Command#getException() exception}.  Also captures a stack of {@link ActionDomainEvent}s.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Note that when invoking an action, other actions may be invoked courtesy
 *     of the {@link WrapperFactory}.  These "sub-actions" do <i>not</i> modify
 *     the contents of the current command object; in other words think of the command
 *     object as representing the outer-most originating action.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     That said, if the sub-action is invoked asynchronously (using
 *     {@link WrapperFactory#asyncWrap(Object, AsyncControl)} or
 *     {@link WrapperFactory#asyncWrapMixin(Class, Object, AsyncControl)}), then
 *     a separate {@link Command} object
 *     is created, and the originating {@link Command} is set to be its
 *     {@link Command#getParentInteractionId() parent}.
